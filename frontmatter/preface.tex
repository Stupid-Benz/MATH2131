\chapter*{Preface}

This book is written by a student in the course MATH 2131 --- Honors in Linear and Abstract Algebra I at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) taught by Professor MENG Guowu during the Fall Semester of the Academic Year 2025--2026.

This book is designed to provide an abstract perspective on linear algebra. The book aims to give rigorous proofs of fundamental theorems in linear algebra while emphasizing the underlying structures and concepts. The book covers topics such as vector spaces, linear transformations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, inner product spaces and more.

The target audience of this book includes undergraduate students studying linear algebra in a rigorous manner, as well as anyone interested in deepening their understanding of linear algebra from an abstract viewpoint. A solid foundation in basic linear algebra and mathematical proof techniques is recommended for readers.
